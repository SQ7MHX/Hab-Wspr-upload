# [ HabHub/SondeHub balloon name, ham callsign of the balloon, band in mhz, channel, timeslot, voltage or ID, comment, when balloon started (YEARMONTHDAYTHOURMINUTE in UTC example 20220530T1125) ]
# [ Timeslot for telemetry datas: Telemetry transmission starting at minute 0 or 2 or 4 or 6 or 8]
# [ID (fixed voltage) instead of battery voltage, (if 0 everything is working as usual), is useful for an extra ID to identify the balloon and must be hardcoded in the pico tracker itself
# [voltage or ID can be 0 (everything is working as usual) or must be an digit for example 4.56]
# FOR HABHUB COMMENTS (only for Habhub) YOU HAVE TO ADD AN EXTRA FIELD WITH THE NAME 'comment' and Type 'String' INTO THE PAYLOAD at http://habitat.habhub.org/genpayload/

# Example with comment:
